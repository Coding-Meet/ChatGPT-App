## Introduction

The ChatGPT App Tutorial series is designed to help you create a powerful chat application for Android using Kotlin and various libraries and tools. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable insights and hands-on guidance in this series.

Throughout these tutorials, you'll learn about UI design, RecyclerView, Room database integration, Retrofit for API communication, MVVM architecture, advanced features like text copying and sharing, OpenAI API integration, and much more.

By the end of this series, you'll have a fully functional and feature-rich chat application that you can further customize and expand upon. Let's get started!

## Part 1: Design Welcome Screen

In this part, you will design the Welcome Screen for your ChatGPT App. You'll learn how to create an appealing and user-friendly welcome screen using Android Studio's layout editor. Additionally, you'll set up the necessary dependencies, such as Retrofit for API integration and Room for local storage, and implement the MVVM architecture for structuring your app.

## Part 2: Designing Chat Screen

Part 2 focuses on designing the Chat Screen. This includes creating a user interface with a RecyclerView, utilizing DiffUtil to efficiently update the UI, and integrating MVVM architecture for managing data. By the end of this part, your chat screen will be ready to display messages.

## Part 3: Advanced Features

Part 3 covers a range of advanced features for your ChatGPT App. You'll learn how to implement internet connectivity checks, utilize the Clipboard Manager for copying messages, integrate Share Intents for sharing messages with other apps, and implement the ability to select and manipulate text within the chat. Additionally, you'll add popup menus for enhanced user interactions.

## Part 4: Integrating OpenAI API

In this part, you'll integrate the OpenAI API using Retrofit to enable chat interactions with GPT-3. You'll learn how to make API requests, handle responses, and ensure secure API key management. This integration will bring your chat app to life with AI-powered responses.

## Part 5: Room Database Integration

Part 5 focuses on integrating the Room Database into your chat screen. You'll set up Room to store chat history locally, allowing users to access their chat conversations even when offline. This part is essential for providing a seamless user experience.

## Part 6: Inserting Robots

In this part, you'll learn how to insert robots into the Robot Screen. You'll implement Retrofit and MVVM architecture to facilitate the insertion of robots, enhancing the variety of chat interactions within your app.

## Part 7: Managing Robots

Part 7 covers the functionality to view, update, and delete robots in your app. You'll implement navigation and Retrofit to manage robots efficiently, providing users with full control over their robot interactions.

## Part 8: Text To Speech and Voice to Text

In this part, you'll add Text To Speech (TTS) and Voice to Text (VTT) capabilities to your chat app. Users will be able to convert text messages to speech and use voice input for sending messages.

## Part 9: Secure API Key Handling

The final part of this tutorial series focuses on securing API keys using encrypted SharedPreferences. You'll learn how to protect sensitive information and ensure the security of your app.
